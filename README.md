# Spaceship-Titanic-Kaggle-Competiton
The project used the dataset provided by the kaggle competiton to train the model. The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. While travelling it met with an accident and half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimesnion, the challenge here is to predict which passengers were transported using the reocrds in the spaceship's computer.
The dataset consisted of missing values which were dealt using various techniques and exploratory data analysis was performed. Then the model was trained on various classification algorithms to get the best accuracy, which was given by a Deep learning model giving an F1 score of 0.89 on validation data. Using this model, I acheived a rank of 292 among 2286 teams with a score of 0.805.
